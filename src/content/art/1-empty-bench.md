name: "The Empty Bench for the One"
subtitle: "On the love that didn't sit here"
description: "The Empty Bench is a scene you understand before you even think about it.

A bench is made for two. Everyone has that image in their head: two people close, sharing silence, leaning into each other like the world is finally calm. Here, that place is empty. Not “nobody sat there today” empty. It’s the kind of empty that feels wrong, like something that belongs to you has been taken away and the shape of it is still there.

The tree above holds many leaves, and they’re like the people we meet in life. Some mattered, some passed, all of them left a trace. But one leaf is different. The gold one. That’s the one person you don’t replace. The one your heart keeps naming even when you try to move on.

And the worst part is: it’s not on the bench. It’s there, but far. Close enough to see, too far to touch.

Still… there’s that tiny, irrational thing we call hope. A strong wind, coming from the right direction, could make that gold leaf fall. The chance is small, almost unfairly small. But if it did fall, it could land where it should have always been: on the bench, beside you.

This painting is about what’s missing, what remains, and that fragile, stubborn hope that life might still turn in the right direction. Just once."
