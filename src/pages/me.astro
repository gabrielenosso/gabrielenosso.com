  <p>
    I am an Italian engineer who paints because logic alone is not enough.
  </p>
  <p>
    I live in Zurich and work with code, data and color science.<br />
    My days move through precision, systems and constraints.<br />
    In the studio I use that same discipline to explore what cannot be measured: longing, silence, unfinished stories between people.
  </p>
  <p>
    I paint with a limited palette and simple, almost quiet compositions.<br />
    This is my engineering instinct turned inward: I remove, refine and strip away until only the necessary remains.<br />
    Each canvas is a controlled experiment in emotion.<br />
    How little can I show and still let you feel something true and unmistakable?
  </p>
  <p>
    My work circles around distance, memory and the spaces where words never arrived.<br />
    I am not interested in spectacle.<br />
    I am interested in images that stay with you, that do not explain themselves at once, that slowly shift as your own inner weather changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    If my paintings have a purpose, it is to invite you into that pause.<br />
    To let you look at human emotion with the same clarity, honesty and curiosity that an engineer brings to a complex problem.

    The scream of silence on canvas.<br />
    For those who seek emotion, not decoration.
